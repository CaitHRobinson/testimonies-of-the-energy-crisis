## Testimonies From The Energy Crisis: Low income households' experiences of paying for energy in a cost of living crisis

ðŸ’¬ **Lanugage:** R

ðŸ“Œ **Project summary:** The project explored peopleâ€™s experiences of energy insecurity over a five-month period from January to May 2023. This was to explore how experiences had changed, as seasons changed and government support was phased out. Interviews were supplemented by participants keeping financial diaries during this period, noting emergent pressures and changes to spend and consumption. Our study directly recruited 25 people from a variety of geographic regions across the United Kingdom. All were from low-income households who were struggling to pay for gas and electricity.
